# Resume

This is just the resume I built using [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com). I have styled it a bit
to make it look like a stack of pages. I also added the ability to remove the styling for printing,
as this seems to work a lot better than a print.css in some browsers.

Feel free to use this as a template for your own resume, any suggestions / pull requests are
welcome.
